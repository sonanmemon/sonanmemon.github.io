excerpt: 'I develop an empirical strategy to construct global monetary policy spillover shocks and examine their transmission across the global economy. More specifically, I use BIS events and IMF debt re-structuring/debt contract events to construct a monetary policy coordination shock. I use local projections and SVAR-IV methodology to measure the tranmission of these shocks, with a focus on the structure of transmission across the world economy.'
