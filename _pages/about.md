👋! I am a second year PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, USA. 




# Background:


I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK where I received the Oxford-Sir Anwar Pervez Graduate Scholarship.

I have worked at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi as a Lecturer of Economics during 2020-2021 and at PIDE (Pakistan Institute of Development Economics), Islamabad as a research fellow during 2021-2024. I also worked with the Asian Development Bank as a consultant in 2024.

# Research Interests 🔬:

My research interests lie in the following areas: 

➜ Identifying monetary policy shocks and their tranmission effects in cross-country, panel data environments.

➜ Understanding the structure of international connectedness of private and central banks by using network science.

➜ Open Economy New Keynesian Models.

➜ Ethnic Frictions in Labor Markets.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as structural VARs and local projections to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission effects vary based on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status and around election cycles/other political economy factors. I am currently working on identiying global monetary coordination shocks.

Secondly, I am fascinated about the network structure of international and intra-national links across private banks and networks among central banks of various nations, where the central nodes are large American banks and the US Federal Reserve System. Understanding this system is critical for effective global coordination of monetary policies for the management of global business cycle fluctuations.

I am also interested in analyzing referal networks and ethnic biases in labor markets; more specifically is there a Sindhi bias in Karachi's private sector and how to design policy to circumvent this?



# Research Skills:

➜ I am proficient in many empirical macroeconomic tools such as the VAR and local projections toolkit.

➜ I can build, solve and calibrate small scale New-Keynesian DSGE models using Julia and DYNARE with MATLAB.

➜ I can code in R, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with higher order expertise in R, STATA and Julia.
