ðŸ‘‹! I am a second year PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 




# Background:


I have a MPhil ðŸŽ“ in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc ðŸŽ“ in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS (Lahore), Pakistan.

In Pakistan, I have studied and worked in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. I worked at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi as a Lecturer of Economics during 2020-2021 and at PIDE (Pakistan Institute of Development Economics: https://pide.org.pk/), Islamabad as a research fellow during 2021-2024. I also worked with the Asian Development Bank as a consultant during Janurary-June 2024.

# Research Interests ðŸ”¬:

My research interests lie in the following areas: 

âžœ Identifying monetary policy shocks and their tranmission in cross-country, panel data environments.

âžœ Understanding the international network structure of private and central banks by using network science.

âžœ New Keynesian Models With Non-Standard Learning and Expectation Assumptions.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as structural VARs, bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission effects vary based on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status and around election cycles/other political economy factors. I am currently working on working on identiying monetary coordination shocks around BIS meeting periods.

Secondly, I am fascinated about the network structure of international and intra-national links across private banks and networks among central/federal banks of various nations, where the central nodes are large American banks and the US Federal Reserve System. Such network structures play a key role in the generation as well as amplification of global financial shocks. Hence, understanding this system is critical for effective global coordination of monetary policies for the management of global business cycle fluctuations.

I am also interested in heterogeneous expectation models, where expectations are diverse and dynamics are driven by the degree of convergence or divergence in expectations and their consequences for monetary policy design.

# Research Skills:

âžœ I am proficient in many applied macro-econometrics/empirical macroeconomic tools including machine learning (neural networks and reinforcement learning).

âžœ I can build, solve and calibrate small and medium-scale DSGE models using MATLAB, Julia and DYNARE.

âžœ I can code in R, MATLAB, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with advanced proficiency in R and Julia.
