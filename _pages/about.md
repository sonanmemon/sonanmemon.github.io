👋! I am a second year PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 




# Background:


I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK where I received the Oxford-Sir Anwar Pervez Graduate Scholarship and a BSc 🎓 in Economics and Mathematics from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Pakistan.

I have worked at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi as a Lecturer of Economics during 2020-2021 and at PIDE (Pakistan Institute of Development Economics: https://pide.org.pk/), Islamabad as a research fellow during 2021-2024. I also worked with the Asian Development Bank as a consultant during Janurary-June 2024.

# Research Interests 🔬:

My research interests lie in the following areas: 

➜ Identifying monetary policy shocks and their tranmission effects in cross-country, panel data environments.

➜ Understanding the structure of international connectedness of private and central banks by using network science.

➜ New Keynesian Models With Non-Standard Learning and Expectation Assumptions.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as structural VARs, bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission effects vary based on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status and around election cycles/other political economy factors. I am currently working on identiying global monetary coordination shocks around BIS meeting periods.

Secondly, I am fascinated about the network structure of international and intra-national links across private banks and networks among central banks of various nations, where the central nodes are large American banks and the US Federal Reserve System. Understanding this system is critical for effective global coordination of monetary policies for the management of business cycle fluctuations on the planet.

I am also interested in heterogeneous expectation models, where expectations are diverse across agents and converge only with delay and under some psychologocial zeitgeists. Optimal monetary policy designs are thus, a function of which expectation formation assumptions are made.


# Research Skills:

➜ I am proficient in many empirical macroeconomic tools such as the VAR toolkit and machine learning algorithms.

➜ I can build, solve and calibrate small and medium-scale DSGE models using MATLAB, Julia and DYNARE.

➜ I can code in R, MATLAB, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with higher order expertise in R and Julia.
