# My Background:


👋! I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA.

I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc 🎓 in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS, Pakistan.

# Research Interests:

My research 🔬 interests lie in the following areas: empirical macroeconomics with an emphasis of estimating monetary policy transmission effects and the intersection of network science and macroeconomics.

Firstly, I use various empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the dynamic, transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission depends on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status, degree of fiscal conservatism of the incumbent government, exchange rate regimes and degree of financial inclusion in response to various local and international shocks.

Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of monetary economics and networks, by inspecting the network structure of international monetary system with respect to consumer expectations and global financial system. For instance, during my MPhil thesis at Oxford, I worked on extending a New Keynesian model to incorporate an inflation expectation formation process driven by social learning and herding of beliefs among consumers In similar vein, I am facinated about the structure of international and national links across private banks and networks among central banks of various nations, where the central nodes are the US Federal Reserve System and large American banks. Such network structures play a key role in the amplification of global shocks and the global coordination of monetary policies for management of global business cycle fluctuations.

# Research Skills:

I am proficient in applied macro-econometric tools including machine learning and solving/calibrating small DSGE models using MATLAB, DYNARE and IRIS-Toolbox. I can also code in R, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with advanced proficiency in R and Julia.
