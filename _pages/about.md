ðŸ‘‹! I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 



# Background:


I have a MPhil ðŸŽ“ in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc ðŸŽ“ in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS, Pakistan.

I have studied and lived in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore and Islamabad in Pakistan. I worked in IBA, Karachi as a Lecturer of Economics during 2020-2021 and at PIDE, Islamabad as a research fellow during 2021-2024.

# Research Interests ðŸ”¬:

My research interests lie in the following areas: 

âžœ Estimating monetary policy transmission effects using exogenous or identified macroeconomic shocks in cross-country, panel data models.

âžœ Understanding the international monetary system and optimal policy deisgn through the network structure of private banks and central banks.

âžœ Heterogenous Agent Models in Learning and Expectation Driven Models.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, bayesian VARS, local projections and dynamic panel models to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission effects vary based on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status, around election cycles and other political economy factors.

Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of monetary economics and networks, by inspecting the network structure of international monetary system and the global finance. I am fascinated about the structure of international and intra-national links across private banks and networks among central/federal banks of various nations, where the central nodes are large American banks and the US Federal Reserve System. Such network structures play a key role in the generation as well as amplification of global financial shocks. Hence, understanding this system is critical for effective global coordination of monetary policies for the management of global business cycle fluctuations.

I am also interested in optimal monetary policy design in heterogeneous expectation models, where expectations are diverse and dynamics are driven by the degree of convergence or divergence in the social learning dynamics. 

# Research Skills:

âžœ I am proficient in many applied macro-econometrics/empirical macroeconomic tools including machine learning methods.

âžœ I can build, solve and calibrate small DSGE models using MATLAB, DYNARE and IRIS-Toolbox. 

âžœ I can also code in R, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with advanced proficiency in R and Julia.
