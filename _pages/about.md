👋! I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 

I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc 🎓 in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS (Lahore), Pakistan.

🔬 My research interests lie in the following areas: empirical macroeconomics with an emphasis of monetary policy transmission and the intersection of network science and macroeconomics.

Firstly, I use various empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the dynamic, transmission channels of monetary policy 🏦 in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission depends on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status, degree of fiscal conservatism of the incumbent government, exchange rate regimes and degree of financial inclusion in response to various local and international shocks.

Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of monetary economics and networks 🕸️, by inspecting 🔎 the structure of international monetary system through expectations and structure of global finance. For instance, during my MPhil thesis at Oxford, I worked on extending a New Keynesian model to incorporate an inflation expectation formation process driven by social learning and herding of beliefs among consumers👬. In In similar vein, I am facinated about the structure of international and national links across private banks and networks among central banks of various nations, where the central node is the US Federal Reserve System and large American banks. This network structure dictates the success or failure of global coordination of monetary policy and hence, management of global business cycle fluctuations.

I am proficient in applied econometric tools including machine learning and solving/estimating medium-sized DSGE models using MATLAB, DYNARE and IRIS-Toolbox. I can also code in R, Julia, Python, and STATA with advanced proficiency in all but Python.
