title: "Network Structure of Global Monetary Policy Spillovers"
collection: JMP
permalink: /_JMP/paper1
excerpt: "I develop an empirical strategy to construct global monetary policy spillover shocks and examine their transmission across the global economy. Using BIS events and IMF debt restructuring and debt contract events, I construct a monetary policy coordination shock. I then employ local projections and SVAR-IV methods to study the network structure of global monetary policy transmission."
